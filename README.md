# Hyprdracula

> *My personal Hyprland setup, handcrafted through a fog of confusion, bad decisions, and AI-enabled incompetence.*

## 🧨 What Is This?

This is my attempt at a fully riced Hyprland setup. It includes all the usual suspects: custom window manager configs, translucent widgets, 17 different launchers, and enough bloat to make even KDE blush.

The name “**Hyprdrac**” doesn’t mean anything. It was probably meant to be cool. Or minimalist. Or something. I don’t remember. Honestly, **neither does ChatGPT**, who wrote 80% of this while I forgot what I even asked for.

## 👎 Why It’s Terrible

- I don't know what half of this code does.
- ChatGPT doesn't know either, because I kept interrupting it mid-command.
- Most of the scripts are half-finished or solutions to problems I no longer have.
- Configuration is a tangled mess of contradictory ideas.
- Styling is inconsistent. Themes are broken. Fonts are misaligned.
- I have no idea why it works — or why it *doesn’t*.
- You will regret trying to understand it. I already do.

## 💾 What’s In This Dumpster Fire

- **Hyprland**: The unstable window manager of choice for people who want to feel something.
- **Waybar**: Custom bar that breaks every time I change anything.
- **Tofi**: Because I thought a third app launcher would help.
- **Hyprpaper** or **swww**: Depends on my mood.
- **Scripts**: Mostly written by ChatGPT. Occasionally by me. Frequently forgotten by both.
- **GTK themes** that only look good if you squint.
- A color scheme that I’ll definitely change again tomorrow.

## 🧠 Installation (If You Insist)

You're brave. Here's how to get this nonsense on your system:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Saltyfunnel/hyprdracula
cd hyprbw
chmod +x scripts/*.sh
cd scripts
sudo sh install.sh
```

You should probably read that script first. It might overwrite stuff. Or break your soul.

## 🧩 Dependencies (aka AUR Hell)

- Arch Linux (because of course)
- `hyprland`
- `waybar`
- `wofi`
- `kitty` or `alacritty` or whatever terminal I was using that week
- `swww`, `playerctl`, `networkmanager`, `blueman`, `pipewire`, probably `dunst`, maybe `eww`, definitely pain
- Fonts? Icons? GTK themes? You'll figure it out.

## 💀 What to Expect

- A slick-looking rice that takes 8 hours to debug.
- A setup that screenshots well and behaves terribly.
- A wall of spaghetti config where even I ask “what the hell is this?”
- Random parts that *look* smart but were actually generated by AI under duress.

## 🤝 Blame Assignment

- **Me**: For not knowing what I was doing but doing it anyway.
- **ChatGPT**: For being an enabler. It just kept agreeing with me, no matter how bad my idea was.
- **You**: For trying to use this.

## 😵 FAQ

**Q: Why is this called HyprBW?**  
A: I don’t know. It sounded cool at the time. Black & White? Brain Worms? Brutal Wasting?

**Q: Is this actually usable?**  
A: Depends on your definition of "usable." If you like your setup fragile and emotionally unstable, yes.

**Q: Why did you publish this?**  
A: So I can `git clone` it after I inevitably nuke my system for fun.

**Q: Can I contribute?**  
A: Sure. But why would you do that to yourself?

## 🖼️ Screenshots?

Nope. Use your imagination. Just picture a half-transparent bar, some unreadable fonts, and a wallpaper that clashes with everything.

## 🧯 License

MIT. Do whatever you want with it. Fork it, delete it, remix it into a cyberpunk tragedy — I won’t stop you. I probably won’t even notice.
